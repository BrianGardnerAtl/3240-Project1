This project is going to be a scanner generator. The scanner
(table-driven DFA) is created using a set of lexical specifications.
These specifications are turned into primitive NFA's that are joined
into one giant NFA. From there the giant NFA is turned into the
table-driven DFA.

Once the scanner is created it should be able to accept a file
that follows the lexical specifications and parse it into tokens
that are returned to the driver program.
